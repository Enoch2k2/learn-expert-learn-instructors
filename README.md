# Interface with Learn Instructors

## Who are the Learn Instructors?

There are two teams that help students to succeed with Learn. The Learn Experts are contractors who work part time to staff the "Ask a Question" feature, providing real time support to students.

The Learn Instructors are full time employees with two main responsibilities:

1. Owning a section of the curriculum. Doing what it takes to help students to learn and complete their section as quickly as possible.

2. Ensuring the quality of our graduates by conducting live assessments to determine how well they have met the functional requirements of the project, can explain the key principles we've been teaching and can live code working functionality.

### The Learn Instructors:

 - [Corinna](http://learn.co/cjbrock) / [corinna@flatironschool.com](corinna@flatironschool.com) / slack: corinna
 - [Luke](http://learn.co/lukeghenco) / [luke@flatironschool.com](luke@flatironschool.com) / slack: luke
 - [Cernan](http://learn.co/cernanb) / [cernan@flatironschool.com](cernan@flatironschool.com) / slack: cernan

## How would a Learn Expert interact with a Learn Instructor?

 - If you raise an issue on a lab, you'll now know who to @ mention on the lab (if no one is listed as the owner of that section of curriculum, you can just @ mention Avidor [@aturkewi]).
 - If a student asks for help with an assessment, you should direct them to the instructor who is responsible for the section containing the assessment (not the instructor who administers that assessment, so if it's a Sinatra issue it goes to Cernan, not Luke)
